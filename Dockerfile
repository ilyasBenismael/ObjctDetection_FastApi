    # System Dependencies: These are libraries that are not written in Python but are required by Python packages.
    # For example, OpenCV relies on certain system libraries to handle graphical operations or other lower-level
    # tasks. These libraries need to be installed at the OS level, and therefore are specified in the 
    # Dockerfile using apt-get. They are not Python packages and thus cannot be listed in requirements.txt.
